            <h2>Question 3: Should We Pursue Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
            <h3>Your answer: No, the risks are too high.</h3>
	    <p>You have decided that AI development is too risky to pursue.</p>
	    <p>The opposing view is that the benefits outweigh the risks and we should pursue AI. This may actually be the less risky choice to create a safe strong AI, because it is unlikely any government body or organization could prevent individual programmers from pursuing AI development. Rebellious programming and hacking are all too common, so an outright ban on development likely would still lead to a strong AI eventually being created, and one much more dangerous than if it were developed by professional organization. If the programming of AI is done with the proper safeguards and checks, hopefully an apocalyptic singularity can be avoided.</p>
	    <p>The list of possible benefits of AI is endless. Some benefits include higher efficiency in industries, less need for humans to perform dangerous tasks, solving the energy crisis, fixing global warming, safer transportation, curing medical illnesses, safeguarding the public, repairing environmental damage, better engineering design, and the list goes on.</p>
