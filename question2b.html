            <h2>Question 2: Are the Potential Consequences of Artificial Intelligence Mostly Positive or Negative?</h2>
            <h3>Your answer: The consequences are mostly negative.</h3>
	    <p>You have said that the consequences are mostly negative. You probably see AI as something that could take away jobs, destroy the economy or destroy or enslave the human race.</p>
	    <p>To analyze this, we are going to look at AI as a medium and analyze it through Marshall McLuhan’s 4 Laws of Media. They are that any new form of media will:</p>
	    <li>enhance a basic human function</li>
	    <li>obsolesce an old medium</li>
	    <li>retrieve an old function</li>
	    <li>reverse or do the opposite of its function in some way</li>
	    <p> Someone opposed to your view would probably focus on what AI enhances and retrieves, as these are typically the more positive aspects of a new medium.</p>
	    <p>According to Marshall McLuhan’s laws of media, if we view weak AI as a medium, we would expect various forms of weak AI to enhance people’s lives in some way. Historically weak AI has allowed for the automated factory, which has decreased the costs of producing many different kinds of products. Currently, weak AI is used in many different places. One could look to cars as an example, where many safety features are controlled by small computers scattered throughout the vehicle. In the future, weak AI can further enhance people’s lives by reducing the need to perform tedious or repetitive tasks such as cleaning (and/or other chores), or even driving. The Roomba is a current example of a way that weak AI could assist people with cleaning, while Google’s driverless car is an example for assisting or entirely automating driving. Having autonomous robots assist people in such ways could free up people’s time such that they could work on other things or for leisure. The beneficial implications of weak AI are such that they reduce the need for people to perform undesirable tasks, or allow for more convenient and efficient ways to accomplish such tasks.</p>
	    <p>While the enhancements due to weak artificial intelligence are clear, as there are many examples and applications in our current society, it is more difficult to determine what strong AI enhances. In theory, strong AI is a machine with human intelligence (or better) and it could accomplish every task, job and chore a human could. It could be said that the purpose of strong AI is to make human life easier in general as machines could complete almost any difficult, tedious and simply unpleasant tasks. AI is also being developed to fill a <a href=”http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/home-robots/pepper-aldebaran-softbank-personal-robot”>social role</a>, robotic maids, educational robots and robots that aid in hospitals and care homes are a possibility. Many other projects such as the Blue Brain project seek to simulate the human brain. The Blue Brain Project began working on a rat brain with the ultimate goal being to simulate the full cortex of the human brain (it is believed that this will be achieved by 2018). In the future, these types of projects could become a basis for replicating human brains on machines. In this way, AI could enhance longevity, as human life would no longer be constrained by the physical body. As the intelligence of AI exceeds that of humans there are many other potential benefits. These may include a cure for all diseases, the end of poverty, a solution to global warming, rapid advancement of science and seemingly impossible engineering feats. Strong AI could be considered the ultimate tool for the advancement of human knowledge and intelligence.</p>
	    <p>This leads to the main differences in the enhancing capabilities of weak versus strong AI. While weak AI has a lot of limitations due to its cognitive deficiency and inability to learn on its own, strong AI has no such limitations because it can be self-adapting and continuously learning. In terms of what these different types of AI could enhance, strong AI is capable of everything weak AI could do and more. This includes everything that humans could do and even more still. The benefits offered by both weak and strong forms of AI are those that make people’s lives easier by reducing the need to perform tedious, dangerous, or otherwise unfavourable tasks. The benefits that could be offered by the development of strong AI over weak AI could be a driving factor in its development in the future.</p>
