            <h2>Question 1: What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
            <h3>Your answer: A thinking, conscious machine that is as good or better than the human brain.</h3>
            <p>You have identified what is known as strong AI. It is as good or better at humans than thinking and it is conscious. </p>
	    <p>The opposing definition of weak AI to yours is called weak AI. When discussing the role of artificial intelligence in our current society it is important to take into account past advances and examples. Current technologies that people consider to be “smart” are called weak AI, because they appear to mimic an aspect of human intelligence, but they are not considered to function at the full level of human intelligence.  One such example would be a chess playing computer (notably “Deep Blue”, although this one has some controversies surrounding it). Specifically, it is the idea that there are tasks that were traditionally human-dominated, but can be broken down into simple and/or repetitive tasks. These forms of AI are already spread throughout society, in the form of the automated assembly line, video/board/card game AI, Siri, and the like. The limitations of these kinds of repetitive/pattern-seeking AI’s are only limited to what we can decompose into a series of repetitive tasks. This may cause a greater impact than many people realize. A supporting example for this would be the jeopardy computer, Watson. The task it is presented is to read and understand an answer, then provide a question to that answer (in jeopardy, players are asked an answer, and then must respond with a question). At first, it seems that the task is far too complicated for an AI to perform because it does not seem to be a repetitive one. However, this task was converted into a series of repetitive sub-tasks using an analysis of historical data that was fed to Watson [3]. These kinds of repetitive-happy artificial intelligence computers will only get more capable as their hardware gets more powerful and as more complex tasks can be decomposed into simpler, more repetitive tasks that such AI’s can handle.</p>
