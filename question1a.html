            <h2>Question 1: What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
            <h3>Your answer: A mechnism that can perform a specific task that humans do (ex. play chess, work an assembly line, etc.).</h3>
            <p>You have identified what is known as weak AI. It can complete human tasks, but is not regarded as conscious or free-thinking.</p>
	    <p>The opposing view to yours is called strong artificial intelligence. Weak AI has become commonplace in society, but that is not what people imagine when they think of true artificial intelligence. What people imagine is called Strong AI, and it is more like the omnipotent supercomputer they have seen in movies such as Terminator, I Robot, and Transcendence. In the movies it is often depicted as an apocalyptic doomsday when the machines change their own programming and build themselves armies of robots to take over the world infested with humans. The futurist presumption is that the processing and computing power has matched, or even exceeded that of the human brain, to the point where it could potentially perform any intellectual task a human could (Moore’s Law and exponential growth of processing power). Even if computers can match the overall processing speed of the human brain this doesn’t mean it can perform the exact same as a brain would. Programmers would be trying to mimic the intellectual functions of the human mind (some of which already exist in weak AI) including linguistic communication, problem-solving, and perception/pattern recognition (examples; Mitsuku, U of A Texas hold’em player, Google car), but the hurdles to reach strong AI would be consciousness and the ability to truly self-learn, which combined, could lead to the dreaded “singularity” event. The idea is when intelligent machines can create even smarter and better machines, it would quickly lead to an “intelligence explosion”, leaving most of mankind far behind in the dust.  IPhones and Google may seem to control the lives of people already (in 2013, ~78% of American teens had cell phones), but if the worst case singularity scenario of a strong AI were to actually occur (and if it allowed for humans to actually survive) everyone would be enslaved into the new world it had created. McLuhan warned about the maelstrom of technology, and how media surrounds and engulfs people, such that they are desensitized to storm around them. McLuhan defines media as a technological extension of one’s self, so is strong AI the ultimate medium, in the sense that it completely mimics the human mind? With the potential benefits/enhancements of supercomputers to help the world (efficiency in industries, cure medical illnesses, perform dangerous tasks, etc.), we still need to consider the other (and potentially harmful) laws of media; what does it make obsolete? How could it reverse?  What does it retrieve?</p>
